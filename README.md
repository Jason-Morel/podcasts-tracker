# podcasts-tracker
 
Hey there!

You have found the repo where Lyna Benyahia and Jason Morel will work on their programming project.

The idea is to build a tool that will allow us to find podcasts depending on their duration and theme. Ideally, we would like to make it work through WhatsApp, to keep the user interface as friendly as possible.

How it would work (subject to changes):
1. user sends a text with a topic and a duration;
2. algo sends back a list of podcasts suggestions matching the criteria.

We will be working closely with the talented Pierre Pelletier.

Come back around mid-March to see the result.
