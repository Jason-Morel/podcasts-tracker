# podcasts-finder
 
Hey there!

You have found the repo where Lyna Benyahia and Jason Morel will work on their programming project.

We noticed that it is not possible to sort podcasts by duration on the Spotify app.
Therefore, the idea is to build a tool which will help finding podcasts depending on their theme AND duration. 
Results will be sent through Telegram so that user can open links from their phone.

##How to use our tool
1. Fork our repo OR download it as a .zip folder;
    ![Download repo](/podcasts-tracker/presentation/images/download_repo.png?raw=true "Download repo as .zip")
2. algo sends back a list of podcasts suggestions matching the criteria.
