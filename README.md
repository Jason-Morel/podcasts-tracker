# podcasts-tracker
 
Hey there!

You have found the repo where Lyna Benyahia and Jason Morel will work on their programming project.

The idea is to build a tool that will allow us to keep track of our favorites podcasts' daily releases. Ideally, we would like to make it work through WhatsApp, to keep the user interface as friendly as possible.

How it would work (subject to changes):
1. User sends a text with a list of the podcasts they want to follow (use regular expression to match this list with Spotify API).
2. Algo sends a text every morning to give details on the freshly released podcasts (title and guests) and sort them by duration.
3. If we have enough time, we could add a tool allowing user to send a text with a theme and a duration so that the algo sends back a text with a list of podcasts suggestions.

We will be working closely with the talented Pierre Pelletier.

Come back around mid-March to see the result.
