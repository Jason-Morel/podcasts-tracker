#Because people usually commute twice a day (home -> office AND office -> home): we could return episodes matching the duration selected by user AND episodes which are twice as long.
#It would allow the user to listen half of the episode in the morning and the other half in the evening.

#How can we approximate episodes duration if API limits the results to 50?
#We could look at the distribution of episodes duration for a specific show.
#Then we would recommend shows to user (instead of episodes).
#It means our tool would not need to be used everyday. Instead, user could use our tool when they feel like discovering new shows which match a specific topic.
